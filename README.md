A multi-body gravity simulator using the Barnesâ€“Hut algorithm written in Fortran and parallelized using OpenMP.

This is a small program I wrote more then a decade ago as I found the Barnes-Hut algorithm interesting and I wanted to
use OpenMP. Don't expect too much from it, it is a toy program. It is somewhat optimized for speed, but the main goal was to learn how to use OpenMP.
I was also not very experienced with Fortran at the time, so the code is not very idiomatic.
